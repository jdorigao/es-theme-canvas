## Theme Conversion

The theme is maintained in dual format (XML and JSON). Use the included
converter to regenerate JSON files from XML:

```bash
# Convert all XML files in the theme directory (uses embedded schema)
python3 resources/convert_theme_xml_to_json.py .

# Convert with verbose output
python3 resources/convert_theme_xml_to_json.py . -v

# Convert a single file
python3 resources/convert_theme_xml_to_json.py theme.xml

# Use an external schema file instead of the embedded one
python3 resources/convert_theme_xml_to_json.py . --schema custom_schema.json
```

The schema is **embedded** in the converter script — no external files needed.
An optional `--schema` flag can override it with a custom schema file.
